    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = settings.GALILEO_URL
        self.api_key = settings.GALILEO_API_KEY
        
    def create_account(self, user_data):
        try:
            response = requests.post(
                f"{self.base_url}/accounts",
                json=user_data,
                headers={"X-API-Key": self.api_key}
            )
            if response.status_code == 200:
                account = Account.objects.create(
                    user_id=user_data['user_id'],
                    galileo_id=response.json()['account_id']
                )
                send_notification.delay(
                    user_data['user_id'], 
                    'account_created'
                )
                return account
            else:
                raise Exception("Failed to create account")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Account creation failed: {e}")
            raise
```

### Part C: Performance Optimization (30 minutes)

**Scenario**: "Our transaction list API takes 15 seconds to load for users with >1000 transactions"

```python
def get_user_transactions(request, user_id):
    transactions = Transaction.objects.filter(user_id=user_id)
    result = []
    for transaction in transactions:
        merchant = Merchant.objects.get(id=transaction.merchant_id)
        category = Category.objects.get(id=merchant.category_id)
        card = Card.objects.get(id=transaction.card_id)
        result.append({
            'id': transaction.id,
            'amount': transaction.amount,
            'merchant_name': merchant.name,
            'category_name': category.name,
            'card_last_four': card.last_four,
            'date': transaction.created_at
