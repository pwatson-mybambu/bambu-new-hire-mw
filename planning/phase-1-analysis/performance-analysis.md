## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the performance bottlenecks, scaling limitations, and optimization opportunities within the MyBambu middleware architecture. The assessment reveals critical scalability issues requiring immediate attention to support business growth and improve system reliability.

## Current Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Task Queue**: Celery with RabbitMQ broker
- **Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance
- **Caching**: Redis (production), DummyCache (development)
- **Web Server**: uWSGI with persistent connections
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ (AMQP)

### Scale Indicators

- **Celery Queues**: 14 specialized queues
- **Scheduled Tasks**: 60+ periodic tasks
- **Database Queries**: 346+ filter operations identified
- **Query Optimizations**: Only 7 instances of select_related/prefetch_related

## Celery Queue Architecture Analysis

### Current Queue Configuration
The middleware implements a sophisticated multi-queue architecture with 14 specialized queues:

1. **APPSFLYER** - Attribution and analytics
2. **AVALARA** - Tax calculations  
3. **BULK_MAIL** - Email/SMS processing
4. **CROSSBORDER** - International transfers
5. **DING** - Mobile top-ups
6. **FTP** - File transfers and Galileo reports
7. **GALILEO** - Core banking operations
8. **HEALTHCHECK** - System monitoring
9. **SALESFORCE** - CRM synchronization
10. **STATEMENTS** - Financial statements
11. **UNIT21** - Fraud detection
12. **VERIFF** - Identity verification
13. **PERSONA** - Additional identity verification
14. **KARD** - Rewards processing

### Performance Bottlenecks in Queue System

#### 1. Queue Congestion
- **Galileo queue overloading**: Critical banking operations share resources with batch processing
- **Cross-queue dependencies**: Tasks routing to wrong queues (e.g., Galileo events using Unit21 queue)
- **No priority differentiation**: Critical real-time operations mixed with batch jobs

#### 2. Task Distribution Issues
```python
# Example of problematic routing from celery.py
('galileo.tasks.account.*', {'queue': unit21_queue}),  # Misrouted critical tasks
('galileo.tasks.authorization.*', {'queue': unit21_queue}),
```

#### 3. Synchronous Subtask Anti-Pattern
Heavy use of synchronous `.get()` calls in tasks creates deadlock potential and worker pool exhaustion.

### Recommended Celery Optimizations

1. **Implement Queue Priorities**
```python
# High-priority configuration
from kombu import Queue
task_queues = {
    Queue('critical', routing_key='critical', 
          delivery_mode=2, durable=True),
    Queue('batch', routing_key='batch', 
          delivery_mode=1, durable=False)  # Transient for performance
}
```

2. **Enable Task Result Optimization**
```python
# Production settings
task_acks_late = True
worker_prefetch_multiplier = 1  # For long-running tasks
task_compression = 'gzip'      # Reduce message size
```

3. **Fix Queue Routing**
- Separate real-time operations from batch processing
- Implement proper queue-to-worker mapping
- Add circuit breakers for external service calls

## Database Architecture Analysis

### Current Database Design Issues

#### 1. Massive N+1 Query Problem
**Critical Finding**: 346 database filter operations vs. only 7 optimized queries
- Ratio: 49:1 unoptimized to optimized queries
- Every relationship access likely triggers additional queries
- Performance degrades exponentially with data growth

#### 2. Model Complexity
- **52 model files** with interdependent relationships
- **400+ database migrations** indicating frequent schema changes
- Complex inheritance hierarchies (GalileoCoreProfile, CfsbCoreProfile, McbCoreProfile)

#### 3. Missing Query Optimization Examples
```python
# PROBLEMATIC: N+1 query pattern (found throughout codebase)
users = User.objects.filter(status='active')
for user in users:
    print(user.profile.address)  # Additional query per user

# OPTIMIZED: Should be (rarely found)
users = User.objects.filter(status='active').select_related('profile__address')
```

### Database Performance Recommendations

1. **Implement Comprehensive Query Optimization**
```python
# Add to all view classes
class UserListView(ListView):
    queryset = User.objects.select_related(
        'profile', 'galileo_core_profile'
    ).prefetch_related(
        'cards', 'transactions__fees'
    )
```

2. **Database Connection Optimization**
```python
# Production database settings
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600,  # Persistent connections
        'CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'MAX_CONNS': 20,
            'MIN_CONNS': 5,
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Add Database Indexes**
```python
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['user', 'created_at']),
        models.Index(fields=['status', 'modified_at']),
        models.Index(fields=['external_id']),  # For API lookups
    ]
```

## Scaling Bottlenecks and Limitations

### 1. Single Point of Failure - Database
- **Architecture**: Single PostgreSQL instance
- **Risk**: Complete system failure if database fails
- **Impact**: No read replicas for scaling read operations
- **Growth Limitation**: Cannot horizontally scale database operations

### 2. Cache Configuration Issues
```python
# Development uses dummy cache - performance issue
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.dummy.DummyCache',
    }
}

# Production Redis cache not optimized
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
        "LOCATION": f'redis://{REDIS_HOST}:{REDIS_PORT}/',
        # Missing: connection pooling, timeout settings
    }
}
```

### 3. Resource Intensive External API Calls
- **60+ scheduled tasks** making external API calls
- No circuit breakers or retry logic visible
- Synchronous API calls blocking worker threads

### 4. Memory and Processing Bottlenecks
```python
# Inefficient user creation process from account.py
def _create_user(self, email, password, **extra_fields):
    # Creates 8 related objects per user registration
    core_profile = GalileoCoreProfile(user=user)
    core_profile = CfsbCoreProfile(user=user)  
    core_profile = McbCoreProfile(user=user)
    # ... additional objects
```

## Technical Debt Inventory

### 1. Legacy Code Patterns
- **Mixed authentication systems**: Multiple user profile types
- **Deprecated functionality**: Comments indicating "TODO: Can remove this maybe?"
- **Migration complexity**: 400+ migrations suggest schema instability

### 2. Configuration Inconsistencies
```python
# Inconsistent debug settings
DEBUG = True  # Should be False in production

# Mixed connection patterns
REDIS_HOST = 'localhost'  # Hardcoded in base, overridden in production
```

### 3. Security and Maintenance Issues
- **Hardcoded credentials**: Configuration references suggest secrets in code
- **Unmaintained integrations**: Multiple external service integrations
- **Testing gaps**: Limited test coverage for critical financial operations

### 4. Monitoring and Observability Gaps
- **Basic logging**: Structured logging present but limited metrics
- **No APM**: No Application Performance Monitoring visible
- **Manual monitoring**: Health checks run every 5 minutes via Celery tasks
