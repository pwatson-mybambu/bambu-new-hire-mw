# Phase 1 Summary: Analysis & Discovery
*MyBambu Middleware Architect Hiring Process*

## Executive Summary
Phase 1 analysis reveals MyBambu operates a complex Django monolith serving 20-30M underbanked Latinos with $170B in annual remittances. The middleware requires urgent architectural transformation to support company growth, with specific challenges in performance (346 N+1 queries), integration complexity (22 third-party services), and scalability (single database instance).

## Key Findings by Analysis Area

### 1. Company Context (company-profile.md)
- **Mission**: Serving underbanked Latino immigrants without immigration status checks
- **Scale**: Targeting 20-30M potential users, 92% current users are Hispanic
- **Growth**: 5x headquarters expansion, adding 190 jobs
- **Strategic Importance**: Middleware architect critical for scaling infrastructure

### 2. Current Architecture (architecture-assessment.md)
- **Scale**: 85 directories, 52 Django apps, 884 API endpoints
- **Monolithic Issues**: High coupling, no service boundaries, single database
- **Natural Services**: Identity, Payments, International Transfers, Communications, Banking Core
- **Technical Debt**: 400+ migrations, mixed authentication, inconsistent APIs

### 3. Integration Landscape (integration-landscape.md)
- **22 Integrations**: Banking, payments, identity, communications
- **Critical Issues**: 7 different auth patterns, no circuit breakers, tight coupling
- **Very High Complexity**: Galileo (200+ APIs), MoneyGram, Salesforce
- **Modernization Need**: Abstraction layers, resilience patterns, monitoring

### 4. Performance Analysis (performance-analysis.md)
- **Critical Issues**: 346 N+1 queries (49:1 ratio), Celery misconfigurations
- **Architecture Scale**: 14 queues, 60+ scheduled tasks, 400+ migrations
- **Quick Wins**: 70-90% performance gains possible with optimization
- **Bottlenecks**: Single database, no caching, queue dependencies

### 5. Market Research (market-research.md)
- **Salary Range**: $150-175K base (competitive for Florida)
- **Competition**: 10-15% premium for Django + microservices expertise
- **Assessment**: 3-6 hour take-home preferred over whiteboarding
- **Differentiators**: Mission-driven role, technical leadership opportunity

### 6. Documentation State (documentation-index.md)
- **Volume**: 851 pages across 8 categories
- **Quality Issues**: 51% stale (2+ years old), no ADRs, external dependencies
- **Critical Gaps**: No API specs, deployment docs, DR procedures
- **Onboarding Need**: 2-3 weeks documentation review required

## Critical Success Factors for New Architect

### Technical Requirements
1. **Monolith Decomposition**: Proven experience breaking apart Django monoliths
2. **Integration Expertise**: Managing 20+ third-party APIs
3. **Performance Optimization**: Database, caching, queue optimization
4. **Financial Domain**: Payment processing, compliance, transaction integrity

### Architectural Priorities
1. **Immediate** (0-30 days): Fix N+1 queries, implement caching, optimize Celery
2. **Short-term** (1-3 months): API gateway, service boundaries, monitoring
3. **Long-term** (3-12 months): Extract 3-4 microservices, event-driven architecture

### Business Impact Metrics
- Reduce deployment time from 2 weeks to 2 days
- Decrease critical incidents by 50%
- Improve system uptime to 99.9%
- Enable independent team deployments

## Risk Areas Requiring Attention

### Technical Risks
1. **Galileo Dependency**: Single point of failure for banking operations
2. **Database Bottleneck**: No replicas, no disaster recovery
3. **Security Gaps**: Hardcoded secrets, mixed authentication patterns
4. **Compliance**: PCI DSS not properly isolated

### Organizational Risks
1. **Knowledge Silos**: Critical knowledge in few individuals
2. **Documentation Debt**: 51% of docs outdated
3. **Team Skills Gap**: Limited microservices experience
4. **Change Management**: Resistance to architectural changes

## Phase 1 Deliverables Completed
✅ Company profile and strategic context
✅ Architecture assessment with 52 apps analyzed
✅ Integration landscape with 22 services mapped
✅ Performance analysis identifying 70-90% improvement opportunities
✅ Market research with salary benchmarks
✅ Documentation index of 851 pages categorized

## Recommendations for Phase 2

### Job Description Focus
- Emphasize monolith-to-microservices transformation experience
- Highlight financial services and compliance requirements
- Include specific technologies: Django, PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker, AWS
- Stress leadership and mentoring responsibilities

### Required Skills Priority
1. Django expertise (5+ years)
2. Microservices architecture (3+ years)
3. Financial services domain (2+ years)
4. Team leadership (2+ years)
5. DevOps/Cloud (AWS preferred)

### Assessment Design Priorities
- Microservice extraction from Django monolith
- API design with resilience patterns
- Performance optimization challenge
