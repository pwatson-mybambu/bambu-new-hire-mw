# ðŸš€ START HERE - Continuation Instructions

## How to Continue This Project

### Step 1: Start New Claude Session
```bash
claude --auto-approve all
```

### Step 2: Provide the Continuation Prompt
Copy and paste the entire contents of:
```
/Users/patrickwatson/git/bambu-workspace/submodules/bambu-new-hire-mw/docs/temp-continuation/CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md
```

### Step 3: Claude Will Automatically
1. Review all Phase 1 completed work
2. Begin Phase 2 tasks immediately
3. Create all required deliverables
4. Work without permission interruptions

## Files in This Folder

1. **CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md** - Main prompt to paste into new Claude session
2. **key-context.md** - Quick reference of important numbers and findings
3. **TODO_CHECKLIST.md** - Explicit checklist of all remaining tasks
4. **START_HERE.md** - This file (instructions)

## What Claude Will Create

### Phase 2 (First ~45 minutes)
- 3 versions of job description
- Skills evaluation matrix
- Ideal candidate profile
- Phase 2 summary and diagram

### Phase 3 (Next ~45 minutes)
- Complete coding challenge (3-6 hours for candidates)
- Interview guide with questions
- Evaluation rubric and scoring
- Phase 3 summary and diagram

### Final Deliverables (~30 minutes)
- Ready-to-post job descriptions
- Complete coding challenge package
- Full hiring playbook

## Expected Timeline
- Total time: ~2.5 hours of Claude work
- Output: Complete hiring framework
- All materials ready to use

## If Context Seems Missing
The continuation prompt includes:
- All file paths to completed work
- Key findings from Phase 1
- Specific numbers and metrics
- Clear task instructions

If Claude seems confused, remind it to:
1. Read the Phase 1 documents first
2. Check `key-context.md` for quick reference
3. Follow `TODO_CHECKLIST.md` sequentially

## Success Indicators
Claude is on track if it:
- âœ… Immediately starts creating job descriptions
- âœ… References specific findings from Phase 1
- âœ… Uses actual numbers (52 apps, 346 N+1 queries, etc.)
- âœ… Creates files in the correct locations

## Note on Conversation History
If you want to provide additional context, the conversation history is typically at:
```
~/.claude/conversations/[latest-timestamp].jsonl
```
However, the continuation prompt should have sufficient context without it.
